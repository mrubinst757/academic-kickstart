We propose a modification of the Stable Balancing Weights (SBW) objective function (Zubizaretta (2015)) for use with region-level data to accomodate sampling variability in the region-level covariates and outcomes. We show that this estimator has improved efficiency relative to SBW in both simulations and real-world applications.
