title: Stable Balancing Weights for Group-Level Data
math: true

We modify the Stable Balancing Weights objective function proposed by Zubizaretta (2015) to account for group-level panel-data. In particular, we propose modifications that return the minimum bias and minimum mean-square-error when the covariates and outcome are measured with sampling variability. We also propose a modification that allows for dependence between regions when treatment assignment is at a higher level that the units. We then show how we can tune this algorithm using pre-treatment outcomes. This paper also relates to the synthetic controls literature, but restricts attention to the case where we can exactly balance the covariates and where we have multiple treated and control units.
