abstract = "We estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion on the adult uninsurance rates in states that did not expand Medicaid in 2014 using a novel extension of the synthetic controls approach (Abadie et al (2010)). The existing literature primarily estimates treatment effects on states that expanded Medicaid. We hypothesize these effects differ: prior to the 2014 expansion, evidence suggested that Medicaid take-up rates are lower among conservative states (Sommers (2012)), and Republicans were more likely to govern non-expansion states. We therefore hypothesize that the treatment effect on states that did not expand Medicaid would have been closer to zero than for states that did expand Medicaid. Using data from the American Communities Survey (ACS), we estimate the effect on non-expansion states by re-weighting expansion regions to approximately balance the covariates from non-expansion regions. We contribute to the literature on balancing weights by accounting for hierarchical data and measurement error in the covariates when calculating our balancing weights. We estimate that Medicaid expansion would have changed the uninsurance rate by -2.00 percentage points (-3.59, -0.40). These results are smaller in absolute magnitude than existing estimates of the ETT (see, eg, Courtenmanche (2017)). We provide evidence that factors associated with Republican governance may drive this difference."
