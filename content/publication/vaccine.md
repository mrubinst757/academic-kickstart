abstract = "Introduction: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy increased among US adults April-December, 2020, and threatens efforts to end the pandemic. Among US adults 18-64 years, we report prevalence of and reasons for vaccine hesitancy, overall and by employment and occupation, during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Methods: The Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University conducted a COVID-19 survey administered by Facebook. In January, February and March, 2021, 791,716, 710,529, and 732,308 Facebook users, respectively, reported age 18-64 years and answered a vaccine acceptance question. Weights matched the sample to the age, gender, and state profile of the US population. Percentages and risk ratios (RR) for vaccine hesitancy were estimated using a weighted Poisson regression; 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using robust standard errors. Results: Vaccine hesitancy decreased among adults 18-64 years from January (27.5% [95%CI, 27.3-27.6]) to March (22.1% [95%CI, 21.9-22.2]). Vaccine hesitancy varied widely by occupational category: 9.6%, (95%CI, 8.5-10.7) in life/physical/social sciences to 46.4% (95%CI, 45.1-47.7) in construction/extraction. Almost half (47.9%, 95%, 47.6-48.3) of hesitant participants indicated concern about side effects, and over a third didn’t believe they needed the vaccine, didn’t trust the government, were waiting to see if it was safe, and didn’t trust COVID-19 vaccines (versus 14.5% [95%CI, 14.3-14.8] who didn’t like vaccines in general). Conclusions: In this nationally representative survey of adults 18-64 years, vaccine hesitancy decreased to 22.1% by March, 2021. Still, hesitancy, which varies widely by occupation, remains a barrier to pandemic control. Reasons for hesitancy indicate messaging about safety and addressing trust are paramount."

# abstract_short = "We estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion on the adult uninsurance rate in states that did not expand Medicaid in 2014. Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), we estimate this effect - the treatment effect on the controls (ETC) - by re-weighting expansion regions to approximately balance the covariates from non-expansion regions using an extension of the stable balancing weights objective function (Zubizarreta (2015)). We contribute to the balancing weights literature by accounting for hierarchical data structure and covariate measurement error when calculating our weights, and to the synthetic controls literature (see, e.g. Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller (2010)) by outlining a set of assumptions that identifies the ETC using time-series cross-sectional data. We estimate that Medicaid expansion would have changed the uninsurance rate by -2.33 (-3.49, -1.16) percentage points. These results are smaller in absolute magnitude than existing estimates of the treatment effect on the treated (ETT), though may not be directly comparable due to the study design, target population, and level of analysis. Regardless, we caution against making inferences about the ETC using estimates of the ETT, and emphasize the need to directly estimate the appropriate counterfactual when they are the quantity of interest."
