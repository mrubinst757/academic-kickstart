I'm a PhD student in the [joint Statistics and Public Policy program](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/phd/statheinz) at Carnegie Mellon University. My broad interests are in statistical and machine learning methods for causal inference and health care policy. I'm especially interested in identification and estimation using panel-data, problems particular to group-level data, and weighting estimators. Before coming to Carnegie Mellon I worked in health data analytics at Mathematica in Washington, DC. In my spare time I also enjoy the outdoors (especially the desert southwest) and improv comedy.
