My name is Max Rubinstein, and I'm a PhD student in the [joint Statistics and Public Policy program](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/phd/statheinz) at Carnegie Mellon University. I previously worked in health care policy research at Mathematica in Washington, DC. My research interests are in statistical and machine learning methods for causal inference in healthcare policy. Right now I'm working in developing reweighting estimators for group-level data, and I'm also generally interested in non-parametric estimation of causal effects. In my spare time I also enjoy the outdoors (especially the desert southwest) and comedy.
