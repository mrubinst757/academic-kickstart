I'm planning to use this as blog about areas of statistics, econometrics, and machine learning, that I find interesting. Lately I've been reading papers about weighting estimators, difference-in-differences, and non-parametric efficiency theory, so I'd expect those to be the main topics in the near future. I love to engage with people about these issues, so feel free to reach out if you think there's a paper I should read, you'd like to discuss any of these topics further, or if seem to have misunderstood something. I think we all do better research when we share knowledge and work together, and I'm hoping to use this as a space to do that.
